     Sorting - Visualizer

 Overview

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help users understand and visualize how different sorting algorithms work in real-time. This project aims to demonstrate various sorting techniques by visually representing the step-by-step process each algorithm follows to sort a given array of numbers.


Features

* Algorithms Supported: Includes common sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
 
* Real-Time Visualization: Users can see the array elements being swapped and sorted as the algorithm progresses, offering a clear understanding of the internal working of each method.
 
* Customizable Array: Users can generate arrays of different sizes with random values or input their own set of numbers for sorting.
 
* Speed Control: Adjustable sorting speed allows users to slow down or speed up the visualization for better understanding.
 
* Educational Insight: Displays the number of comparisons, swaps, and steps taken, providing insight into the algorithm's efficiency.
